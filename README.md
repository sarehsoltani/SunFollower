# SunFollower
In modern solar tracking systems, the solar panels are fixed on a structure that moves according to the position of the sun.
Let us design a solar tracker system using two servo motors, 6 light sensors and Arduino UNO board to rotate the solar panel towards the Sun or a source of light.

Interface Circuit Design course final project under the supervision of Prof. Mahdi Sedighi
